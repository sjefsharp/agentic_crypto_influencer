This contributed to a global cryptocurrency market capitalization drop of $130 billion, from $4.01 trillion to $3.88 trillion, marking one of the most substantial single-day losses in the digital asset class's history. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, trading around $111,000-$112,000 USDT with a 24-hour decrease of approximately 1.85% to 2.71%. Furthermore, Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) experienced substantial net outflows of $1.17 billion between August 18 and 22, with BlackRock's IBIT alone seeing $615 million in redemptions, indicating waning institutional interest. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) briefly surged past $4,900 to reach a new all-time high, now holding above $4,700, potentially boosted by dovish signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. XRP continues to trade above $3. The overall crypto market cap shed about 1% in the past 24 hours, with over $650 million in liquidations, predominantly affecting long positions.\n\nMarket sentiment for Bitcoin appears bearish in the derivatives market, with 52.7% of perpetual futures positions being short. However, the overall crypto market sentiment score, based on technical indicators, is currently neutral at 54. Rising chatter about Federal Reserve rate cuts is viewed as a potential risk for crypto. Despite recent volatility, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings with an $11.8 million purchase, now possessing nearly 19,000 BTC. VanEck maintains its bullish $180,000 Bitcoin forecast.\n\n**Regulation:**\nSignificant strides in cryptocurrency regulation have been observed. The US GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill, has been signed into law, a development many in the industry consider a watershed moment for the US to catch up in the regulatory landscape. Brazil has implemented new tax policies, eliminating tax exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all digital asset capital gains. In the UK, authorities are actively targeting financial networks, including cryptocurrency platforms, exploited by Russia to circumvent sanctions. Domestically, a Pennsylvania bill proposes jailing public officials who hold crypto after 90 days and mandates disclosures. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve has indicated that American banks should engage with crypto without fear of penalties. However, the SEC has continued to delay decisions on several crypto ETFs.\n\n**Technology:**\nTechnological advancements continue to shape the crypto ecosystem. LayerZero successfully acquired the cross-chain platform Stargate for $110 million, aiming to enhance interoperability within the DeFi space. The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is experiencing substantial growth, projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, with a 70% growth this year to $26.5 billion, and Ethereum currently leads this market. In other news, Chainlink has partnered with SBI Group to develop crypto tools for cross-chain tokenized RWAs for APAC banks. Additionally, BAY Miner has released a high-performance mobile app, transforming smartphones into cloud mining hubs. Toyota is also reportedly exploring blockchain technology to digitize vehicle ownership.", "name": "run_crypto_search", "call_id": "", "is_error": false}], "type": "FunctionExecutionResultMessage"}, {"content": "Here is the draft for the X post:\n\nBitcoin saw a flash crash & $1.17B ETF outflows, while Ethereum hit a new ATH above $4,900.

VanEck has also filed to launch the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, testing the SEC's evolving stance on staking.\n*   **Global Crypto Taxation**: Governments worldwide are increasingly eyeing digital assets for tax revenue, with Brazil eliminating its tax exemption for minor crypto gains and imposing a 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets.\n\n**Technology & Development:**\n\nInnovation in the crypto space continues with several notable advancements:\n\n*   **RWA Tokenization**: The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, showing significant momentum with an all-time high of $26.5 billion, a 70% growth year-to-date.

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable decline, dropping below the 113,000 USDT, 112,000 USDT, and even 111,000 USDT marks, reflecting a 1.85% to 3.40% decrease within the past 24 hours. This dip is attributed to a \"risk-off sentiment\" as institutional demand for Bitcoin dwindles, and spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded over $1.15 billion in outflows.\n\nIn the altcoin market, Ethena (ENA), Lido (LDO), and Pump.fun (PUMP) are leading the losses, contributing to over $650 million in market liquidations. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) showed a mixed trend, initially experiencing outflows but later seeing a turnaround with significant inflows of approximately $288 million and $341 million on Thursday and Friday, respectively. Ethereum recently surpassed the 4,900 USDT mark, reflecting a 3.26% increase in the last 24 hours (as of August 24, 2025). Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting signs of recovery, with improving market sentiment indicated by rising Open Interest and stablecoin market capitalization.

In other news, Pudgy Penguins, an NFT project, has ambitious plans to reach $50 million in revenue this year and aims for a public stock listing by 2027.\n\n**Regulation:**\nThe United States has made significant strides in cryptocurrency regulation. The \"Genius Act\" stablecoin regulation bill has been signed into law, hailed as a \"watershed moment\" that could attract substantial investment into the US stablecoin sector and reinforce US dollar dominance. Additionally, the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, has passed the House of Representatives and is now moving to the Senate. However, concerns have been raised by critics regarding the US Treasury's initiative to embed ID checks into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts, citing potential privacy erosion.\n\nInternationally, Brazil has enacted new tax policies, eliminating exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, signaling a global trend of governments looking to digital assets for revenue. Japan's Finance Minister has expressed support for including crypto in investment portfolios and pledged to foster a robust trading environment for the sector. VanEck has filed for the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, which will test the SEC's evolving stance on staking. Trish Turner has resigned from her role as the head of the IRS crypto division.\n\n**Technology:**\nIn technological advancements, Chainlink (LINK) has formed a strategic partnership with Japan's SBI Group to develop decentralized finance (DeFi) product offerings. Block has introduced \"Proto Rig\" and \"Proto Fleet,\" designed to enhance Bitcoin mining efficiency and extend hardware lifespan.

This contributed to a global cryptocurrency market capitalization drop of $130 billion, from $4.01 trillion to $3.88 trillion, marking one of the most substantial single-day losses in the digital asset class's history. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, trading around $111,000-$112,000 USDT with a 24-hour decrease of approximately 1.85% to 2.71%. Furthermore, Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) experienced substantial net outflows of $1.17 billion between August 18 and 22, with BlackRock's IBIT alone seeing $615 million in redemptions, indicating waning institutional interest. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) briefly surged past $4,900 to reach a new all-time high, now holding above $4,700, potentially boosted by dovish signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. XRP continues to trade above $3. The overall crypto market cap shed about 1% in the past 24 hours, with over $650 million in liquidations, predominantly affecting long positions.\n\nMarket sentiment for Bitcoin appears bearish in the derivatives market, with 52.7% of perpetual futures positions being short. However, the overall crypto market sentiment score, based on technical indicators, is currently neutral at 54. Rising chatter about Federal Reserve rate cuts is viewed as a potential risk for crypto. Despite recent volatility, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings with an $11.8 million purchase, now possessing nearly 19,000 BTC. VanEck maintains its bullish $180,000 Bitcoin forecast.\n\n**Regulation:**\nSignificant strides in cryptocurrency regulation have been observed. The US GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill, has been signed into law, a development many in the industry consider a watershed moment for the US to catch up in the regulatory landscape. Brazil has implemented new tax policies, eliminating tax exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all digital asset capital gains. In the UK, authorities are actively targeting financial networks, including cryptocurrency platforms, exploited by Russia to circumvent sanctions. Domestically, a Pennsylvania bill proposes jailing public officials who hold crypto after 90 days and mandates disclosures. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve has indicated that American banks should engage with crypto without fear of penalties. However, the SEC has continued to delay decisions on several crypto ETFs.\n\n**Technology:**\nTechnological advancements continue to shape the crypto ecosystem. LayerZero successfully acquired the cross-chain platform Stargate for $110 million, aiming to enhance interoperability within the DeFi space. The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is experiencing substantial growth, projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, with a 70% growth this year to $26.5 billion, and Ethereum currently leads this market. In other news, Chainlink has partnered with SBI Group to develop crypto tools for cross-chain tokenized RWAs for APAC banks. Additionally, BAY Miner has released a high-performance mobile app, transforming smartphones into cloud mining hubs. Toyota is also reportedly exploring blockchain technology to digitize vehicle ownership.", "source": "SearchAgent", "type": "UserMessage"}, {"content": "Here is the draft for the X post:\n\nBitcoin saw a flash crash & $1.17B ETF outflows, while Ethereum hit a new ATH above $4,900.

This sharp decline is largely attributed to substantial whale transactions and increased outflows from spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\n*   **Bitcoin (BTC)**: The leading cryptocurrency fell 2.61% to $111,891, with a further 1.6% decline on the weekly chart, and dipped below the $113,000 USDT mark at one point. A major contributing factor was an unidentified whale selling 24,000 BTC, valued at over $2.7 billion, which triggered a flash crash and caused Bitcoin's price to drop by $4,000 within minutes. Despite the sale, the whale still holds over $17 billion worth of BTC, raising concerns about future market pressure. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $1.17 billion in net outflows between August 18 and August 22, with BlackRock's IBIT accounting for $615 million.\n*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Ethereum also saw a pullback, losing 2.89% on the week after reaching a new all-time high, briefly topping $4,900. A long-time Bitcoin whale reportedly exchanged approximately 22,769 BTC (worth $2.59 billion) for Ethereum over the past five days, acquiring 472,920 ETH in spot trades and opening a $577 million long position on Hyperliquid, signaling a strategic bet on Ethereum. Ethereum ETFs also experienced $238 million in net outflows, ending a 14-week streak of inflows.\n*   **Liquidations**: Over the past 24 hours, crypto markets faced $664 million in liquidations, with long positions accounting for $502 million and shorts for $160 million. Bitcoin traders saw $237 million liquidated, and Ethereum followed with $215 million, highlighting significant volatility.\n*   **Derivatives Sentiment**: Bitcoin's 24-hour perpetual futures long-short ratios show a bearish sentiment, with 52.7% short positions across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io, indicating that a majority of traders expect prices to fall in the near term.\n\n**Regulatory Updates:**\n\nSeveral significant regulatory developments have emerged:\n\n*   **US GENIUS Act**: The US GENIUS Act, a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, has been signed into law, a development many in the industry consider a \"watershed moment\" that could spur significant investment in the US stablecoin space.\n*   **IRS Digital Assets Chief Resignation**: Trish Turner has resigned as the head of the IRS crypto division after only three months, reportedly moving to the private sector.\n*   **Pennsylvania Bill**: A proposed bill in Pennsylvania could lead to officials holding crypto being jailed after 90 days, with lawmakers facing $50,000 fines and prison if caught holding digital assets.\n*   **UK Sanctions**: The UK is targeting financial networks, including cryptocurrency exchanges Grinex and Meer, used by Russia to evade sanctions, as part of efforts to curb military funding and crack down on sanctions circumvention.\n*   **ETF Filings**: Grayscale and Bitwise are among firms updating their filings for spot XRP ETFs. VanEck has also filed to launch the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, testing the SEC's evolving stance on staking.\n*   **Global Crypto Taxation**: Governments worldwide are increasingly eyeing digital assets for tax revenue, with Brazil eliminating its tax exemption for minor crypto gains and imposing a 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets.\n\n**Technology & Development:**\n\nInnovation in the crypto space continues with several notable advancements:\n\n*   **RWA Tokenization**: The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, showing significant momentum with an all-time high of $26.5 billion, a 70% growth year-to-date.

Hong Kong is set to implement new banking capital regulations based on Basel Committee standards for crypto assets starting January 1, 2026.\n\nGlobally, governments are increasingly looking at digital assets for tax revenue, exemplified by Brazil eliminating tax exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a 17.5% flat tax on capital gains from digital assets. There are also ongoing efforts to combat the use of crypto in illicit activities, with the UK targeting crypto networks exploited by Russia to circumvent sanctions. This includes sanctions against specific cryptocurrency exchanges and a new rouble-backed token.\n\nIn the US, a Pennsylvania bill proposes jailing public officials who hold crypto after 90 days, with potential fines and prison time.

Federal Reserve officials have reportedly been discussing stablecoins extensively following the GENIUS Act's passage.\n\nInternationally, Brazil is exploring a Bitcoin strategic reserve and has recently implemented a 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, signaling a global trend of governments targeting crypto for revenue. Hong Kong plans to fully implement new banking capital regulations based on Basel Committee's crypto asset standards starting January 1, 2026. The UK has also targeted financial networks and cryptocurrency exchanges used by Russia to circumvent sanctions, including a new rouble-backed token.

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable decline, dropping below the 113,000 USDT, 112,000 USDT, and even 111,000 USDT marks, reflecting a 1.85% to 3.40% decrease within the past 24 hours.

This contributed to a global cryptocurrency market capitalization drop of $130 billion, from $4.01 trillion to $3.88 trillion, marking one of the most substantial single-day losses in the digital asset class's history. Bitcoin's price has been volatile, trading around $111,000-$112,000 USDT with a 24-hour decrease of approximately 1.85% to 2.71%. Furthermore, Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) experienced substantial net outflows of $1.17 billion between August 18 and 22, with BlackRock's IBIT alone seeing $615 million in redemptions, indicating waning institutional interest. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) briefly surged past $4,900 to reach a new all-time high, now holding above $4,700, potentially boosted by dovish signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. XRP continues to trade above $3. The overall crypto market cap shed about 1% in the past 24 hours, with over $650 million in liquidations, predominantly affecting long positions.\n\nMarket sentiment for Bitcoin appears bearish in the derivatives market, with 52.7% of perpetual futures positions being short. However, the overall crypto market sentiment score, based on technical indicators, is currently neutral at 54. Rising chatter about Federal Reserve rate cuts is viewed as a potential risk for crypto. Despite recent volatility, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings with an $11.8 million purchase, now possessing nearly 19,000 BTC. VanEck maintains its bullish $180,000 Bitcoin forecast.\n\n**Regulation:**\nSignificant strides in cryptocurrency regulation have been observed. The US GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill, has been signed into law, a development many in the industry consider a watershed moment for the US to catch up in the regulatory landscape. Brazil has implemented new tax policies, eliminating tax exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all digital asset capital gains. In the UK, authorities are actively targeting financial networks, including cryptocurrency platforms, exploited by Russia to circumvent sanctions. Domestically, a Pennsylvania bill proposes jailing public officials who hold crypto after 90 days and mandates disclosures. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve has indicated that American banks should engage with crypto without fear of penalties. However, the SEC has continued to delay decisions on several crypto ETFs.\n\n**Technology:**\nTechnological advancements continue to shape the crypto ecosystem. LayerZero successfully acquired the cross-chain platform Stargate for $110 million, aiming to enhance interoperability within the DeFi space. The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is experiencing substantial growth, projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, with a 70% growth this year to $26.5 billion, and Ethereum currently leads this market. In other news, Chainlink has partnered with SBI Group to develop crypto tools for cross-chain tokenized RWAs for APAC banks. Additionally, BAY Miner has released a high-performance mobile app, transforming smartphones into cloud mining hubs.

Despite the sale, the whale still holds over $17 billion worth of BTC, raising concerns about future market pressure. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $1.17 billion in net outflows between August 18 and August 22, with BlackRock's IBIT accounting for $615 million.\n*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Ethereum also saw a pullback, losing 2.89% on the week after reaching a new all-time high, briefly topping $4,900. A long-time Bitcoin whale reportedly exchanged approximately 22,769 BTC (worth $2.59 billion) for Ethereum over the past five days, acquiring 472,920 ETH in spot trades and opening a $577 million long position on Hyperliquid, signaling a strategic bet on Ethereum.

VanEck has also filed to launch the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, testing the SEC's evolving stance on staking.\n*   **Global Crypto Taxation**: Governments worldwide are increasingly eyeing digital assets for tax revenue, with Brazil eliminating its tax exemption for minor crypto gains and imposing a 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets.\n\n**Technology & Development:**\n\nInnovation in the crypto space continues with several notable advancements:\n\n*   **RWA Tokenization**: The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, showing significant momentum with an all-time high of $26.5 billion, a 70% growth year-to-date.

There are also ongoing efforts to combat the use of crypto in illicit activities, with the UK targeting crypto networks exploited by Russia to circumvent sanctions. This includes sanctions against specific cryptocurrency exchanges and a new rouble-backed token.\n\nIn the US, a Pennsylvania bill proposes jailing public officials who hold crypto after 90 days, with potential fines and prison time.

Federal Reserve officials have reportedly been discussing stablecoins extensively following the GENIUS Act's passage.\n\nInternationally, Brazil is exploring a Bitcoin strategic reserve and has recently implemented a 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, signaling a global trend of governments targeting crypto for revenue. Hong Kong plans to fully implement new banking capital regulations based on Basel Committee's crypto asset standards starting January 1, 2026. The UK has also targeted financial networks and cryptocurrency exchanges used by Russia to circumvent sanctions, including a new rouble-backed token. A proposed bill in Pennsylvania could jail public officials who hold crypto after 90 days and mandate disclosures, with lawmakers facing fines and prison for non-compliance.\n\n**Technology and Development:**\nIn technology news, LayerZero has successfully acquired the cross-chain platform Stargate for $110 million, aiming to enhance interoperability within the DeFi space.

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable decline, dropping below the 113,000 USDT, 112,000 USDT, and even 111,000 USDT marks, reflecting a 1.85% to 3.40% decrease within the past 24 hours. This dip is attributed to a \"risk-off sentiment\" as institutional demand for Bitcoin dwindles, and spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded over $1.15 billion in outflows.\n\nIn the altcoin market, Ethena (ENA), Lido (LDO), and Pump.fun (PUMP) are leading the losses, contributing to over $650 million in market liquidations. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) showed a mixed trend, initially experiencing outflows but later seeing a turnaround with significant inflows of approximately $288 million and $341 million on Thursday and Friday, respectively. Ethereum recently surpassed the 4,900 USDT mark, reflecting a 3.26% increase in the last 24 hours (as of August 24, 2025). Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting signs of recovery, with improving market sentiment indicated by rising Open Interest and stablecoin market capitalization. Chris Burniske, a notable figure in the crypto space, anticipates continued improvement for Solana's (SOL) exchange rates against ETH and BTC despite current market challenges. In other news, Pudgy Penguins, an NFT project, has ambitious plans to reach $50 million in revenue this year and aims for a public stock listing by 2027.\n\n**Regulation:**\nThe United States has made significant strides in cryptocurrency regulation. The \"Genius Act\" stablecoin regulation bill has been signed into law, hailed as a \"watershed moment\" that could attract substantial investment into the US stablecoin sector and reinforce US dollar dominance. Additionally, the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, has passed the House of Representatives and is now moving to the Senate. However, concerns have been raised by critics regarding the US Treasury's initiative to embed ID checks into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts, citing potential privacy erosion.\n\nInternationally, Brazil has enacted new tax policies, eliminating exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, signaling a global trend of governments looking to digital assets for revenue. Japan's Finance Minister has expressed support for including crypto in investment portfolios and pledged to foster a robust trading environment for the sector. VanEck has filed for the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, which will test the SEC's evolving stance on staking. Trish Turner has resigned from her role as the head of the IRS crypto division.\n\n**Technology:**\nIn technological advancements, Chainlink (LINK) has formed a strategic partnership with Japan's SBI Group to develop decentralized finance (DeFi) product offerings. Block has introduced \"Proto Rig\" and \"Proto Fleet,\" designed to enhance Bitcoin mining efficiency and extend hardware lifespan. The Polkadot community is actively voting on proposals for significant supply and inflation reduction measures, with a forthcoming JAM upgrade expected to transform its blockchain capabilities. The concept of Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) is gaining traction, with predictions that they could unlock a massive $400 trillion Traditional Finance (TradFi) market.

Market sentiment has cooled to \"neutral,\" with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 47.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) experienced a flash crash below $110,000 after a whale reportedly sold 24,000 BTC, but it has since recovered to trade around $112,533, down about 2.24% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin's 24-hour perpetual futures long-short ratios indicate a bearish sentiment, with 52.7% short positions across major exchanges, suggesting expectations of further price declines in the near term. Over $664 million in crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with $502 million in long positions, highlighting significant market volatility. Bitcoin spot ETFs also saw outflows totaling $1.17 billion last week, mirroring the cautious mood.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has been a focal point, hitting a new all-time high near $4,953 on Friday after dovish remarks from US Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential September rate cut. While it briefly surpassed $4,900, Ethereum has since eased to around $4,716, still up nearly 9% over the past week. On-chain data suggests a shift in whale activity from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Ethereum spot ETFs also saw negative outflows of $238 million, breaking a 14-week streak of inflows, which indicates a shift in investor sentiment for digital assets.\n\nAltcoins presented a mixed performance, with Hyperliquid outperforming with a 6% rise, while Solana, Cardano, and Chainlink saw modest gains. Tron, XRP, and BNB edged lower. Cardano is showing signs of recovery with increasing Open Interest and stablecoin market capitalization. Chainlink (LINK) gained over 1% following a partnership announcement with Japan's SBI Group, focusing on DeFi product offerings. Ethena (ENA), Lido (LDO), and Pump.fun (PUMP) led losses among altcoins, starting the week under pressure.\n\n**Regulation:**\n\nRegulatory developments continue to be a significant theme. The US has seen the \"Genius Act\" stablecoin regulation bill signed into law, which is considered a major milestone for the industry. This has prompted the EU to accelerate its digital euro plans, reportedly exploring Ethereum and Solana as potential platforms. Hong Kong is set to implement new banking capital regulations based on Basel Committee standards for crypto assets starting January 1, 2026.\n\nGlobally, governments are increasingly looking at digital assets for tax revenue, exemplified by Brazil eliminating tax exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a 17.5% flat tax on capital gains from digital assets. There are also ongoing efforts to combat the use of crypto in illicit activities, with the UK targeting crypto networks exploited by Russia to circumvent sanctions. This includes sanctions against specific cryptocurrency exchanges and a new rouble-backed token.\n\nIn the US, a Pennsylvania bill proposes jailing public officials who hold crypto after 90 days, with potential fines and prison time. The IRS also saw its head of the crypto division resign after only a few months.\n\n**Technology:**\n\nWhile specific groundbreaking technological advancements in the last 24 hours were not extensively detailed, several mentions indicate ongoing development and adoption:\n\n*   Toyota is exploring blockchain technology to digitize vehicle ownership.\n*   SBI Group's partnership with Chainlink will focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) product offerings.\n*   Polkadot's community is voting on significant supply and inflation reduction measures, and the anticipated JAM upgrade aims to transform its blockchain capabilities.\n*   The discussion around potential platforms for the digital euro by the EU (Ethereum and Solana) highlights the ongoing consideration of public blockchains for central bank digital currencies.\n*   A report by Skynet suggests the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, indicating significant growth potential for blockchain applications beyond traditional cryptocurrencies.", "name": "run_crypto_search", "call_id": "", "is_error": false}]}, {"id": "cde82a59-75c3-4a2c-bc27-bb49e7260e35", "source": "SummaryAgent", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3834, "completion_tokens": 89}, "metadata": {}, "created_at": "2025-08-25T09:52:03.204219Z", "content": "Here is the draft for the X post:\n\nBTC flash crashed below $110K, then recovered; saw $1.17B ETF outflows.

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable decline, dropping below the 113,000 USDT, 112,000 USDT, and even 111,000 USDT marks, reflecting a 1.85% to 3.40% decrease within the past 24 hours. This dip is attributed to a \"risk-off sentiment\" as institutional demand for Bitcoin dwindles, and spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded over $1.15 billion in outflows.\n\nIn the altcoin market, Ethena (ENA), Lido (LDO), and Pump.fun (PUMP) are leading the losses, contributing to over $650 million in market liquidations. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) showed a mixed trend, initially experiencing outflows but later seeing a turnaround with significant inflows of approximately $288 million and $341 million on Thursday and Friday, respectively. Ethereum recently surpassed the 4,900 USDT mark, reflecting a 3.26% increase in the last 24 hours (as of August 24, 2025). Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting signs of recovery, with improving market sentiment indicated by rising Open Interest and stablecoin market capitalization. Chris Burniske, a notable figure in the crypto space, anticipates continued improvement for Solana's (SOL) exchange rates against ETH and BTC despite current market challenges. In other news, Pudgy Penguins, an NFT project, has ambitious plans to reach $50 million in revenue this year and aims for a public stock listing by 2027.\n\n**Regulation:**\nThe United States has made significant strides in cryptocurrency regulation.

Additionally, the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, has passed the House of Representatives and is now moving to the Senate. However, concerns have been raised by critics regarding the US Treasury's initiative to embed ID checks into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts, citing potential privacy erosion.\n\nInternationally, Brazil has enacted new tax policies, eliminating exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, signaling a global trend of governments looking to digital assets for revenue. Japan's Finance Minister has expressed support for including crypto in investment portfolios and pledged to foster a robust trading environment for the sector. VanEck has filed for the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, which will test the SEC's evolving stance on staking.
