Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable decline, dropping below the 113,000 USDT, 112,000 USDT, and even 111,000 USDT marks, reflecting a 1.85% to 3.40% decrease within the past 24 hours. This dip is attributed to a "risk-off sentiment" as institutional demand for Bitcoin dwindles, and spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded over $1.15 billion in outflows.\n\nIn the altcoin market, Ethena (ENA), Lido (LDO), and Pump.fun (PUMP) are leading the losses, contributing to over $650 million in market liquidations. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) showed a mixed trend, initially experiencing outflows but later seeing a turnaround with significant inflows of approximately $288 million and $341 million on Thursday and Friday, respectively. Ethereum recently surpassed the 4,900 USDT mark, reflecting a 3.26% increase in the last 24 hours (as of August 24, 2025). Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting signs of recovery, with improving market sentiment indicated by rising Open Interest and stablecoin market capitalization. Chris Burniske, a notable figure in the crypto space, anticipates continued improvement for Solana\'s (SOL) exchange rates against ETH and BTC despite current market challenges. In other news, Pudgy Penguins, an NFT project, has ambitious plans to reach $50 million in revenue this year and aims for a public stock listing by 2027.\n\n**Regulation:**\nThe United States has made significant strides in cryptocurrency regulation. The "Genius Act" stablecoin regulation bill has been signed into law, hailed as a "watershed moment" that could attract substantial investment into the US stablecoin sector and reinforce US dollar dominance. Additionally, the Clarity Act, which seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, has passed the House of Representatives and is now moving to the Senate. However, concerns have been raised by critics regarding the US Treasury\'s initiative to embed ID checks into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts, citing potential privacy erosion.\n\nInternationally, Brazil has enacted new tax policies, eliminating exemptions for minor crypto gains and imposing a flat 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, signaling a global trend of governments looking to digital assets for revenue. Japan\'s Finance Minister has expressed support for including crypto in investment portfolios and pledged to foster a robust trading environment for the sector. VanEck has filed for the first US ETF backed by a liquid staking token, JitoSOL, which will test the SEC\'s evolving stance on staking. Trish Turner has resigned from her role as the head of the IRS crypto division.\n\n**Technology:**\nIn technological advancements, Chainlink (LINK) has formed a strategic partnership with Japan\'s SBI Group to develop decentralized finance (DeFi) product offerings.
